## Introduction
This is the code for the ZMM-TTS submitted to the [IEEE TASLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14398). This paper presents ZMM-TTS, a multilingual and multispeaker framework utilizing quantized latent speech representations from a large-scale, pre-trained, self-supervised model. Our paper is the first to incorporate the representations from text-based and speech-based self-supervised learning models into multilingual speech synthesis tasks. We conducted comprehensive subjective and objective evaluations through a series of experiments. Our model has been proven effective in terms of speech naturalness and similarity for both seen and unseen speakers in six high-resource languages. We also tested the efficiency of our method on two hypothetical low-resource languages. The results are promising, indicating that our proposed approach can synthesize audio that is intelligible and has a high degree of similarity to the target speaker's voice, even without any training data for the new, unseen language.

Welcome to try our code and pre-trained model on different languages!

## Release 
- [20/01] ðŸ”¥ We released code and model pre-trained on 6 language (English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish) public datasets.

## Samples
Samples are provided on [our demo page](https://gongchenghhu.github.io/TASLP-demo/).

## Installation

ZMM-TTS requires Python>=3.8, and a reasonly recent version of PyTorch.
To install ZMM-TTS and make a quick synthesis, you can run from this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nii-yamagishilab-visitors/ZMM-TTS.git

cd ZMM-TTS
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
#In addition, you may need to install these libraries to support full functionality.
pip install transformers  #For support XLSR-53 and XphoneBERT model.
pip install speechbrain   #For extracting speaker embedding.
```
If you want to try IPA representations, you need to install [Epitran](https://github.com/dmort27/epitran).

## Usage
### Prepapre multilingual multispeaker dataset MM6
In my paper, the training data we used contained [GlobalPhone](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6639248), and unfortunately that is not an open source data. 
Considering the scarcity of publicly multilingual and multilingual speaker databases for speech synthesis, I designed the following training database based on the [MLS](https://www.openslr.org/94/) and [NHT Swedish](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jimregan/nst_swedish_tts) databases and called it MM6. (It seems that NST is no longer open for downloads in Swedish, in which case you will not have to consider Swedish.)
|Language|Gender|Speakers|Sentences|Durations (h)|Database|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|English|Female|20|4000|13.9|MLS|


### load model
```python
from speechtokenizer import SpeechTokenizer

config_path = '/path/config.json'
ckpt_path = '/path/SpeechTokenizer.pt'
model = SpeechTokenizer.load_from_checkpoint(config_path, ckpt_path)
model.eval()
```
### Extracting discrete representations
```python
import torchaudio
import torch

# Load and pre-process speech waveform
wav, sr = torchaudio.load('<SPEECH_FILE_PATH>')

# monophonic checking
if wav.shape(0) > 1:
    wav = wav[:1,;]

if sr != model.sample_rate:
    wav = torchaudio.functional.resample(wav, sr, model.sample_rate)

wav = wav.unsqueeze(0)

# Extract discrete codes from SpeechTokenizer
with torch.no_grad():
    codes = model.encode(wav) # codes: (n_q, B, T)

RVQ_1 = codes[:1, :, :] # Contain content info, can be considered as semantic tokens
RVQ_supplement = codes[1:, :, :] # Contain timbre info, complete info lost by the first quantizer
```

### Decoding discrete representations
```python
# Concatenating semantic tokens (RVQ_1) and supplementary timbre tokens and then decoding
wav = model.decode(torch.cat([RVQ_1, RVQ_supplement], axis=0))

# Decoding from RVQ-i:j tokens from the ith quantizers to the jth quantizers
wav = model.decode(codes[i: (j + 1)], st=i) 
```
